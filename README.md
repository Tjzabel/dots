## Purpose
This repository hosts most configuration files I use for my everyday laptop. Within, there are configs for multiple different WM, WM/DE setups: i3-gaps, i3+XFCE, bspwm, and bspwm+XFCE.
As you can tell, I like to try out many different window managers, and my setup tends to change every few months. Once I find a setup that works for me on that particular setup, I add those relevant configurations into this repo. Feel free to take what you like!

**Current Setup**: *i3-gaps*
